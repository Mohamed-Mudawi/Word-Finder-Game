# Word-Finder-Game

This is a game inspired by the NY Times Game "Spelling Bee."

In the NY Times Game, the user is given 7 letters and has to create words from them. One letter in the center has to be a part of every word the user creates

In the NY Times version, the words are only a finite set of possibilities of the variations of the letters which changes daily. But in this version, every time the program is run, all the letters in the English alphabet are randomly mixed and are different every time with exceptions of rare cases. Because the letters are random, the program takes data of thousands of English words from a website. 

The user can find as many combinations of words as possible, but because the letters are randomly mixed every time the program is run, the possibility of words may differ every run.
